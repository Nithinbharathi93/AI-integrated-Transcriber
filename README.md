# 🎙️ AI-integrated-Transcriber

A voice-based transcription and AI response generator powered by **Google Gemini** and **React Speech Recognition**. This app records speech, transcribes it in real-time, and sends the result to Gemini for intelligent interpretation and feedback.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 Real-time speech-to-text using `react-speech-recognition`
- 🤖 AI response generation using Google's `@google/generative-ai`
- ⚡ Fast and responsive interface with Vite and React
- 🌀 Simple microphone control for recording
- 🔁 Easy reset functionality to clear transcriptions and AI outputs

## 📸 Demo

> *Hold the mic button to record voice input, release to generate AI response.*

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User presses the mic button to start recording.
2. Audio is transcribed live via `react-speech-recognition`.
3. On release, the transcript is sent to Google Gemini using the `@google/generative-ai` SDK.
4. AI response is fetched and rendered below the transcription.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** + **Vite** – Fast front-end framework and bundler
- **React Speech Recognition** – Voice transcription
- **Google Generative AI SDK** – AI prompt processing
- **CSS / Icons** – Custom UI with `react-icons`
